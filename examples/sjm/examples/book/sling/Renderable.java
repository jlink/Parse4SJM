/**
 * This class contains a Sling function and the number of
 * lines to use in rendering the function. Note that the
 * number of lines may itself be a function. Also note
 * that the number of lines to use when rendering will be
 * evaluated at the beginning of a plot, when time = 0.
 * At rendering time, the number of lines is:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     nLine.eval().f(0).y
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * For example, nLine might be 100*s1 + t. Say the slider is 
 * halfway over. At rendering time, t = 0 and nLine will 
 * evaluate to 100*.5 + 0, or 50. The function f(0) returns a 
 * point, which will be (0, 50). The y value of this point
 * is 50 and thus the number of lines to use will be 50.
