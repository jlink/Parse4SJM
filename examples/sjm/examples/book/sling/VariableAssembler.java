 * This class looks up a variable by name, using the word on

 * <p>
 * This class expects an assembly's target to be a <code>
 * SlingPlot</code> object. The target has a "scope", which is 
 * a collection of variables organized by name. When this 
 * assembler works on an assembly, it pops a name from the 
 * stack, looks up a variable in the scope using the name, and 
 * pushes the variable onto the stack. This lookup creates the 
 * variable in the scope if the scope does not already contain 
 * a variable of that name.
