/**
 * This class represents the location of a sling stone in 
 * terms of the length of a sling's strap, and the angle (in 
 * radians) around the slinger's head.
 * <p>
 * The constructor accepts two source functions. The y 
 * component of the first function represents the length of 
 * the strap, and the y component of the second function 
 * represents the strap's angle.
 * <p>
 * When you whirl a sling, the stone's path covers 2*pi 
 * "radians" of arc as the stone makes one revolution. The 
 * number "pi" is equal to the ratio of a circle's 
 * circumference to its diameter, about 3.1416. As a stone 
 * makes one revolution, its arc varies from 0 to 2*pi, 
 * starting in the positive x direction and rotating 
 * counterclockwise.
 * <p>
 * We can use the variable r to represent the strap's length, 
 * and the variable theta to represent the strap's angle. At 
 * any point in time, the stone's position is <code>polar(r, 
 * theta)</code>. This is equivalent to <code>cartesian(r * 
 * cos(theta), r * sin(theta))</code>, since the <code>cos
 * </code> and <code>sin</code> functions represent the x and 
 * y components of a stone's path.
