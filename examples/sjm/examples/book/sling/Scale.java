/**
 * A scale represents the relationship of two temporal 
 * variables that vary linearly with each other.
 *
 * In Sling, the most common example of a scale is the 
 * relationship of user coordinates to panel coordinates.
 *
 * For example, in plotting a unit circle, a square that 
 * bounds the circle has its minimum point at (-1, -1), and 
 * its maximum at (1, 1). The minimum is at the lower left 
 * corner, where the panel coordinate might be (52.0, 262.0). 
 * The maximum is at the upper right, where the panel 
 * coordinate might be (314.0, 0.0).
 *
 * If <code>c</code> is a circle function in user coordinates, 
 * then the following definition will create <code>s</code> as 
 * a function that returns the panel coordinate as a function 
 * of time:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre> 
 *     Scale s = 
 *         new Scale(min, c, max, lowerLeft, upperRight); 
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * The function <code>s</code> maps every point on the user's 
 * circle to a point on the panel.
