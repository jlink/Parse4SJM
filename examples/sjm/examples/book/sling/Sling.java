 * This class represents the location of a sling stone in 
 * terms of the length of a sling's strap, and the speed
 * of the stone's rotation around the slinger's head.
 * <p>
 * The constructor accepts two source functions. The y 
 * component of the first function represents the length of 
 * the strap, and the y component of the second function 
 * represents the stone's angular speed. A speed of 1
 * represents one full rotation that occurs during the course
 * of a plot.
