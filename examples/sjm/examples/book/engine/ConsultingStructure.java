	 * A consulting structure proves itself true by unifying with the head of a
	 * rule in a program, and then asking the tail of that rule to prove itself.
	 * Unification is a kind of matching. Two structures unify if they have
	 * equal functors, and the terms all unify. A variable unifies with a
	 * structure simply by setting its instantiation to be the structure.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * For example, the following structures can unify: <blockquote>
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 *     starred(jamesCagney, Title, Year)
	 *     starred(jamesCagney, &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;, 1942)
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * </blockquote>
	 * 
	 * When these structures unify, the variable Title will bind itself to
	 * "Yankee Doodle Dandy", and Year will bind to 1942. To be more specific,
	 * Title will bind to the atom whose functor is "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Year
	 * will bind to the atom whose functor is the number 1942.
	 * 
	 * @return <code>true</code>, if this structure can unify with an axiom in
	 *         the axiom source
