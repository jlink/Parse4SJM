/**
 * A Gateway is a structure that can prove its truth at most once before
 * failing.
 * <p>
 * Examples of gateways are comparisons, negations, and mathematical
 * evaluations. For example, <code>Age > 
 * 18</code> is either true or not, it cannot prove itself in more than one way.
 * Also, <code> not married(X)</code> is true only if the structure
 * <code>married(X)</code> cannot prove itself at all.
 * <p>
 * The fact that gateways can be true only once is important in rules. For
 * example, a rule might contain: <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     ..., plays(jim, Game, Rating), 
 *         Rating &gt;= 7, likes(jane, Game), ...
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote> As this rule proves itself, if it finds a game that Jim plays
 * with a rating of, say, 8, the rule will accept that <code>Rating >= 7</code>.
 * The rule will then proceed to prove the structures after the comparison. The
 * rule may succeed with the latter structures many times, but eventually these
 * structures will run out of proofs, and the rule will fail back to the
 * comparison structure.
 * <p>
 * On failing back, the rule will ask the comparison for its next proof. This
 * amounts to asking if there is a different way to prove that 8 is greater than
 * or equal to 7. Since the comparison has already succeeded once, which allowed
 * the rule to check the latter structures, on failing back the comparison will
 * fail. This will cause the rule to fail back to the preceding
 * <code>plays</code> structure, which may be able to find other proofs.
 * <p>
 * If a preceding structure succeeds, the rule will move forward again, and ask
 * a gateway to prove itself. Since the gateway has failed, it will try again to
 * prove itself.

	 * A gateway is a structure that can prove itself in at most one way. After
	 * a successful proof, a gateway leaves its gate open.
	 * <p>
	 * If the gate is open when this method executes, this method will shut the
	 * gate and return false. This occurs after a gateway has proven itself true
	 * once, and a rule has failed back to the point where it is asking the
	 * gateway for another proof.

	 * If the gate is not open and this gateway can prove itself, then this
	 * method will return true and leave the gate open. Returning true allows
	 * the containing rule to go on to prove whatever structures follow this
	 * one. When the rule fails back to this gateway, the gate will be open, and
	 * at that time this gateway will fail.
	 * <p>
	 * <li>
	 * If the gate is not open and this gateway can not prove itself, this
	 * method returns false.
