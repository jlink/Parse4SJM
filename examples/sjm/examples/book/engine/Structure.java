/**
 * A Structure is a functor associated with a number of terms; a functor can be
 * any object. A term is an object that implements the Term interface, including
 * structures and variables.
 * <p>
 * An example of a structure is: <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * starred(jamesCagney, &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;, Year)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote> This structure has the String <code>"starred"</code> as its
 * functor. This structure's first term is another structure that has
 * "jamesCagney" as its functor and no terms of its own. Similarly, the second
 * term is a structure with the functor "Yankee Doodle Dandy" and no terms of
 * its own. The third term is a variable, Year.
 * <p>
 * This particular example has two elements that favor a parser: the quotes
 * around the film title and the capitalization of the variable. When using
 * Structure and Variable directly, you do not need the kinds of clues a parser
 * needs. So, Yankee Doodle Dandy is just another string, whose internal blanks
 * are not at all confusing. Further, a variable can have any string as its
 * name, not necessarily capitalized.
 * <p>
 * You can create the starred example with <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Structure s = new Structure(&quot;starred&quot;, new Term[] { new Structure(&quot;jamesCagney&quot;), new Structure(&quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;),
 * 		new Variable(&quot;Year&quot;) });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote> To be able to prove itself against a program, a structure must
 * appear in a Rule. Rules associate like-named variables in a "scope", which is
 * essentially a dictionary. A rule makes an executable copy of itself by
 * creating a new variable dictionary, and by making "consulting" copies of its
 * structures.
