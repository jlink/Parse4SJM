 * This command mimics a normal "for" loop, such as:
 * 
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; limit; i++) {
 * 	// body
 * }

 * This class retains four parameters which the constructors receive or
 * establish. These parameters are a setup command, a condition, an end command,
 * and a body command.
 * <p>
 * The <code>execute</code> method executes a "for" loop, essentially executing:
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 *     for (setup; condition; endCommand){
 *         bodyCommand;
 *     }
 * </pre>
