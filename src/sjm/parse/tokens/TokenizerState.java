/**
 * A tokenizerState returns a token, given a reader, an initial character read
 * from the reader, and a tokenizer that is conducting an overall tokenization
 * of the reader. The tokenizer will typically have a character state table that
 * decides which state to use, depending on an initial character. If a single
 * character is insufficient, a state such as <code>SlashState</code> will read
 * a second character, and may delegate to another state, such as
 * <code>SlashStarState</code>. This prospect of delegation is the reason that
 * the <code>nextToken()</code> method has a tokenizer argument.
