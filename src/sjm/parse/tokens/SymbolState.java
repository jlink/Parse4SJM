/**
 * The idea of a symbol is a character that stands on its own, such as an
 * ampersand or a parenthesis. For example, when tokenizing the expression
 * <code>(isReady)&
 * (isWilling) </code>, a typical tokenizer would return 7 tokens, including one
 * for each parenthesis and one for the ampersand. Thus a series of symbols such
 * as <code>)&( </code> becomes three tokens, while a series of letters such as
 * <code>isReady</code> becomes a single word token.
 * <p>
 * Multi-character symbols are an exception to the rule that a symbol is a
 * standalone character. For example, a tokenizer may want less-than-or-equals
 * to tokenize as a single token. This class provides a method for establishing
 * which multi-character symbols an object of this class should treat as single
 * symbols. This allows, for example, <code>"cat <= dog"</code> to tokenize as
 * three tokens, rather than splitting the less-than and equals symbols into
 * separate tokens.
 * <p>
 * By default, this state recognizes the following multi- character symbols:
 * <code>!=, :-, <=, >=</code>
