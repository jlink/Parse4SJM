/**
 * A <code>SymbolNode</code> object is a member of a tree that contains all
 * possible prefixes of allowable symbols. Multi- character symbols appear in a
 * <code>SymbolNode</code> tree with one node for each character.
 * 
 * For example, the symbol <code>=:~</code> will appear in a tree as three
 * nodes. The first node contains an equals sign, and has a child; that child
 * contains a colon and has a child; this third child contains a tilde, and has
 * no children of its own. If the colon node had another child for a dollar sign
 * character, then the tree would contain the symbol <code>=:$</code>.
 * 
 * A tree of <code>SymbolNode</code> objects collaborate to read a (potentially
 * multi-character) symbol from an input stream. A root node with no character
 * of its own finds an initial node that represents the first character in the
 * input. This node looks to see if the next character in the stream matches one
 * of its children. If so, the node delegates its reading task to its child.
 * This approach walks down the tree, pulling symbols from the input that match
 * the path down the tree.
 * 
 * When a node does not have a child that matches the next character, we will
 * have read the longest possible symbol prefix. This prefix may or may not be a
 * valid symbol. Consider a tree that has had <code>=:~</code> added and has not
 * had <code>=:</code> added. In this tree, of the three nodes that contain
 * <code>=:~</code>, only the first and third contain complete symbols. If, say,
 * the input contains <code>=:a</code>, the colon node will not have a child
 * that matches the 'a' and so it will stop reading. The colon node has to
 * "unread": it must push back its character, and ask its parent to unread.
 * Unreading continues until it reaches an ancestor that represents a valid
 * symbol.
